## Project Experience 
### Blockchain | Car Mileage Tracker

### Android Development 

Worked on Project Management | Team Player 

Collaborated with a team to develop an android application called Reversible Learning, a study app that utilizes "the flashcard" method to aid in learning. Utilized Android development skills to create a functional and user-friendly application with features such as: 
- Allows users to add and practice questions, then reveal the answers by
”reversing” the notes. The flashcard method can aid in studying **upto 2 times** more than traditional methods.
- Features a user interface for creating and organizing notes and archiving past questions.
- Demonstrated strong skills in teamwork and Android development with **UI/UX designer, Object Orientation in Java, HyperSQL database and the Three layers Software Engineering Architecture.**
